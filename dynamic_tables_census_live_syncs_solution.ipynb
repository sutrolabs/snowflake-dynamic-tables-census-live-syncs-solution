For this example, we'll be using [Braze](https://docs.getcensus.com/destinations/available-destinations/braze).\n\n### Create the Sync\nUsing the navigation menu on the left side of [Census](https://app.getcensus.com), navigate to **Syncs**, then click the **New Sync** button in the upper right corner.\nThe New Sync page appears.\n\n1. Under **Select a Source**, pick **Any Warehouse Table**, select your Snowflake connection, and select your database, schema, and the `order_delivered_email_sends` dynamic table.\n2. Under **Select a Destination**, select your Braze connection, and select an existing Braze API-triggered campaign or API-triggered canvas.\n3. Under **Select a Sync Behavior**, choose **Activate Events**. This ensures that emails are only sent when new records are added. Then choose **Send**.\n4. Under **Select as Sync Key**, choose your `customer_id` column, and map this to the Braze **External ID** field.\n5. Map additional columns to custom attributes in Braze. These attributes can be used to customize the email template that your send. For example, you can greet the customer by name by mapping the `customer_name` column, and refer to their order number using the `order_number` column.\n6. Click **Next** to proceed to the Sync Summary page.\n7. Under **Select a Run Mode**, choose **Live**. Census will create and continuously monitor a [Snowflake Stream](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/streams-intro) to track and activate changes to your dynamic table as they occur.\n8. Click **Create**, then, on the Sync Details page, click the toggle in the upper right corner of the page to enable your Live Sync."

You can query the `SYNC_LOG` view to access information about all your Census syncs.\n\nIf you look in the Census schema, you will also find the Snowflake Stream that Census created when you created your Live Sync. Do not read from this stream yourself, because reading from a stream consumes the data inside it, preventing Census from being able to activate the data for your.\n\nNote that new entries in your sync log from a Census Live Sync may take seconds or minutes to appear."
